Name: The Reverse Nardwuar

Description: An application that takes in a primary music artist and does a Breadth First Search (BFS)
 through a graph where all music artists on Spotify are nodes and a collaboration on a song (on Spotify) is
 an edge between the artists on the song. The BFS is done only for a given depth (as otherwise it would run
 indefinitely). While doing this search, the program checks if the node representing a second given music
 artist is found. If it is, then we use the concept of Strong Triadic Closure (STC) to determine that there
 is a chance that they will collaborate together in the future. This chance is dependent on the depth at
 which the second artist is found (the distance from the first artist) which can be thought of a loosening
 of the STC property with a probabilistic outcome rather than a definite one. The inputs are two strings
 representing two music artists and an integer representing the depth of the search and the output is a
 percentage likelihood of those artists collaborating.

 of the concept of the STC)

Type: Implementation Project

Credit: This was an individual project, so obviously all of it was me. **Let me note that a good chunk of
 the functionality to do with Spotify account authorization was taken directly from the Spotify API
 instructions and therefore is not my code.** Nevertheless, everything else (absolutely everything to do
 with the application's main function) and many alterations to their authorization functionality was
 written by me.
